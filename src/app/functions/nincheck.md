# Check Belgian National Identification Number

The National Identification Number (NIN) - in Dutch: Rijksregister Nummer (RR) - is a unique identification number that is assigned to every person registered in the National Register of Belgium.

## The identification number contains 11 digits

- A first group of six digits, formed by the date of birth in the order: year, month, day. Month and/or day may be zero if the exact date of birth is not known. If the person is not registered in the National Register, but data must still be kept for social security, for example foreign employees who stay in Belgium for less than three months or cross-border workers, a bis number is assigned. With the bisnummer, the month of birth is increased by 20 or 40. If the gender is known at the time of the application, the month of birth is increased by 40, otherwise it is increased by 20. If the person is a refugee and the date of birth is not known, the month of birth is set to 00 and the day of birth set to 00.
- A second group of three numbers serves to identify people born on the same day. This serial number is even for a woman and odd for a man. It is the daily counter of births. For a man from 001 to 997 and for a woman from 002 to 998.
- A third group of two digits is a check digit based on the 9 preceding digits. This is calculated by dividing the nine-digit number, which is formed by the concatenation of the date of birth and the serial number, by 97. The remainder of this division ("modulo") is subtracted from 97. The difference thus obtained is the control number. For people born in or after 2000, put a 2 in front of the nine-digit number (+ 2000000000) before dividing by 97.

Example: If a man was born on February 1, 1990, a possible number is 90.02.01-997-04. After all, 900201997 divided by 97 is 9280432+93. The difference of 97 and the remainder yields 97 - 93 = 04.
